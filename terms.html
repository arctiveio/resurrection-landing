            <h5>2. Your Rights in and to User Generated Content.</h5>
            <p>1. Subject to the following restrictions, You retain the rights to the User Generated Content You submit, post or display on or to the Siminars or the Simversity Website.</p>
            <p>i. By submitting, posting or displaying Your User Generated Content on or to the Siminars or the Simversity Website, You grant Simversity and Licensor a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, fully paid-up and royalty-free license to reproduce, perform, publish, create derivative works from, publicly display and distribute User Generated Content through the Siminars, on the Simversity Website or through other products and services developed by Simversity or Licensor. You also allow Simveristy to control and limit access to the UGC displayed and distributed through the Siminars and on the Simversity Website, for example limiting access only to other users in Private Siminars if the UGC is submitted in a Private Siminar.</p>
            <p>ii. This license shall be operative even if Simversity or Licensor receives compensation or remuneration through operation of the Siminars or the Simversity Website, through any derivative works prepared by Simversity or Licensor from the Siminars, Siminars' Content or the Simversity Website, or through any of User Generated Content submitted, posted or displayed on the Siminars or the Simversity Website.</p>
            <p>iii. Simversity may restrict the visibility or accessibility of your UGC within the Siminars or Simversity Website. For example, content within a Private Siminar may be restricted to sharing only with Users within the Private Siminar, while for retail and free siminars, fewer restrictions may apply. Any restrictions shall at all times be subject to Simversity's sole discretion.</p>

            <p>2. Simversity welcomes Your feedback. Siminars encourages communication between the Siminars community and is open to suggestions made by Users.

            <p>3. You understand and acknowledge that Simversity or Licensor may transmit or distribute User Generated Content submitted to the Siminars over various electronic networks and in various media and make such changes to User Generated Content as necessary to conform and adapt content to the Siminars.

Certain content submitted by You may be considered "Crowdsourced Content," where Crowdsourced Content is considered the novel content or material that You, in conjunction with other Users, create for the Siminars pursuant to a group assignment or other directive issued through the Siminars. Title in and to such Crowdsourced Content shall vest to Licensor upon submission of such Crowdsourced Content to the Siminars or to Licensor. Licensor shall grant to You and to other Users involved in the creation of such Crowdsourced Content a perpetual license to use such Crowdsourced Content, or any derivative work created therefrom, for your own noncommercial or not-for-profit activities so long as You attribute the Crowdsourced Content as belonging to Licensor or in any other manner specified by Licensor (but not in any manner that suggests that Licensor endorses You or Your use of the Crowdsourced Content).</p>

Simversity disclaims any and all responsibility for any delay that may occur in deleting Your Personally Identifiable Information or Private Information from the Online Course's Website.</p>

            <p>4.

            <h4>Provider Terms of Use</h4>

            <p>This Provider Terms of Use Agreement ("Provider Agreement"), is made by and between Simversity, Inc. ("Simversity") and You ("Provider"), a person who desires to use Simversity's proprietary online platform (the "Simversity Platform") available at the Simversity Website(s) (the "Simversity Website") for the delivery of the Siminar online courses (the "Siminars"). Simversity and Provider may be individually referred to as a "Party" or collectively as the "Parties" to this Provider Agreement. This Provider Agreement governs the use of the Simversity Platform and is effective as of the earlier of the date on which Provider first uses the Simversity Platform or the date on which Provider may have executed a pricing sheet ("Pricing Sheet") with Simversity. If Provider does not agree to this Provider Agreement, Provider may not use the Simversity Platform for the hosting or delivery of any Siminar. Provider must be of legal age (over eighteen years of age in the United States) to use the Simversity Platform.</p>

            <p>Provider hereby retains Simversity to host one or more Siminars on the Simversity Platform for enrollees of the proprietary program(s) developed by Provider (the "Provider Program(s)"). Simversity hereby grants Provider a nonexclusive license to access and use the Simversity Platform to provide Siminars to enrollees of the Siminars ("Users"). The license granted in this Section does not grant Provider any right to access or copy the underlying source code of the Simversity Platform or Simversity Website or to reproduce, alter, modify, reverse engineer, decompile or create a derivative work from the Simversity Platform or Simversity Website.</p>

The most recent version of the Provider Agreement will always appear on the Simversity Website and Provider will always be bound by the most recent version of this Provider Agreement. If Provider does not accept the changes to this Provider Agreement, Provider must cease using the Simversity Platform and this Provider Agreement will terminate.

Provider understands and acknowledges that Simversity may transmit or distribute Provider Program Content submitted to the Siminars over various public electronic networks and in various media; and make such changes to Provider Program Content as necessary to conform and adapt content to the Siminars.</p>
            <p>2. For the Term of this Provider Agreement, Provider hereby grants Simverstiy a fully-paid up, royalty-free, worldwide and exclusive license to the Provider Program Content and Siminars derived from the Provider Program Content for the purposes of hosting and providing the Siminars on and through the Simversity Platform and Simversity Website.</p>
            <p>3.

            <p>4. Providers may, through the user interface(s) provided on the Simversity Platform, if any, control the accessibility and visibility of Provider Program Content or change what Provider Program Content is available to Users based upon whether such Provider Program Content is within a Private Siminar.

            <p>5. Provider hereby represents and warrants that: (i) it holds title in and to the Provider Program Content, or is a licensee of the Provider Program Content that it does not hold title in and to, and that the portions of the Provider Program Content that it does not hold title in and to or is a licensee of are either in the public domain or available for Provider's use under a "fair use" exception to U.S. Copyright Law; (ii) it has the power to license or sublicense the relevant portions of the Provider Program Content and the Siminars to Simversity; and (iii) to the best of its knowledge, neither the Provider Program Content nor Provider's trademarks which may be used in the Siminars violate or infringe upon the intellectual property rights of any third party.</p>

For the Term of this Provider Agreement, Provider hereby grants Simverstiy a fully-paid up, royalty-free, worldwide and exclusive license to the Crowdsourced Content for the purposes of hosting and providing the Siminars using such Crowdsourced Content on and through the Simversity Platform and for Simversity's own marketing or advertising efforts.
