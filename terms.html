            <h5>2. Your Rights in and to User Generated Content.</h5>
            <p>1. Subject to the following restrictions, You retain the rights to the User Generated Content You submit, post or display on or to the Siminars or the Simversity Website.</p>
            <p>i. By submitting, posting or displaying Your User Generated Content on or to the Siminars or the Simversity Website, You grant Simversity and Licensor a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, fully paid-up and royalty-free license to reproduce, perform, publish, create derivative works from, publicly display and distribute User Generated Content through the Siminars, on the Simversity Website or through other products and services developed by Simversity or Licensor. You also allow Simveristy to control and limit access to the UGC displayed and distributed through the Siminars and on the Simversity Website, for example limiting access only to other users in Private Siminars if the UGC is submitted in a Private Siminar.</p>
            <p>ii. This license shall be operative even if Simversity or Licensor receives compensation or remuneration through operation of the Siminars or the Simversity Website, through any derivative works prepared by Simversity or Licensor from the Siminars, Siminars' Content or the Simversity Website, or through any of User Generated Content submitted, posted or displayed on the Siminars or the Simversity Website.</p>
            <p>iii. Simversity may restrict the visibility or accessibility of your UGC within the Siminars or Simversity Website. For example, content within a Private Siminar may be restricted to sharing only with Users within the Private Siminar, while for retail and free siminars, fewer restrictions may apply. Any restrictions shall at all times be subject to Simversity's sole discretion.</p>

            <p>2. Simversity welcomes Your feedback. Siminars encourages communication between the Siminars community and is open to suggestions made by Users.

            <p>3. You understand and acknowledge that Simversity or Licensor may transmit or distribute User Generated Content submitted to the Siminars over various electronic networks and in various media and make such changes to User Generated Content as necessary to conform and adapt content to the Siminars.

Certain content submitted by You may be considered "Crowdsourced Content," where Crowdsourced Content is considered the novel content or material that You, in conjunction with other Users, create for the Siminars pursuant to a group assignment or other directive issued through the Siminars. Title in and to such Crowdsourced Content shall vest to Licensor upon submission of such Crowdsourced Content to the Siminars or to Licensor. Licensor shall grant to You and to other Users involved in the creation of such Crowdsourced Content a perpetual license to use such Crowdsourced Content, or any derivative work created therefrom, for your own noncommercial or not-for-profit activities so long as You attribute the Crowdsourced Content as belonging to Licensor or in any other manner specified by Licensor (but not in any manner that suggests that Licensor endorses You or Your use of the Crowdsourced Content).</p>

Simversity disclaims any and all responsibility for any delay that may occur in deleting Your Personally Identifiable Information or Private Information from the Online Course's Website.</p>

            <p>4.

The most recent version of the Provider Agreement will always appear on the Simversity Website and Provider will always be bound by the most recent version of this Provider Agreement. If Provider does not accept the changes to this Provider Agreement, Provider must cease using the Simversity Platform and this Provider Agreement will terminate.

Provider understands and acknowledges that Simversity may transmit or distribute Provider Program Content submitted to the Siminars over various public electronic networks and in various media; and make such changes to Provider Program Content as necessary to conform and adapt content to the Siminars.</p>
            <p>2.

            <p>4.
