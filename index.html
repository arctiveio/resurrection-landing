                    <p class="fw-light text-secondary">After over a decade of delivering online learning across a wide variety of industries and topics, we regret to announce that&nbsp;due to some large technical constraints as well as significant changes in staffing and revenue due in part to the COVID epidemic, it has become unsustainable for us to continue to operate the Siminars platform.</p>
                    <h4 class="fw-light text-secondary">For Students</h4>
                    <p class="fw-light text-secondary">If you were a student in one of the courses offered, you may have received a notification from your instructor about how to continue to access your content on a different platform. If you haven't please reach out to your instructor directly to address the issue.</p>
                    <h4 class="fw-light text-secondary">For Instructors</h4>
                    <p class="fw-light text-secondary">If you were an instructor with a recently active paid plan and published courses, you would have received a link to download all your course content via dropbox. Please check your email including your junk or spam folder if you haven't seen this link. If you'd like to have a link to your new course location listed here, please reach out to the support email you have in your inbox. Please note that it may take a while for you to receive a response as we are only updating this sporadically.</p>
                    <h4 class="fw-light text-secondary">Access</h4>
                    <p class="fw-light text-secondary">The site will no longer support login after the end of April. In the meantime you can still login <a href="siminars.com/continue">here</a>.</p>
                    <p class="fw-light text-secondary">We want to thank you all for your support over the years. Siminars was an early pioneer in online learning when we launched over 12 years ago. The industry and competitive landscape have changed dramatically in the past few years and we are sure you will be able to find a solid alternative among the many options.<br></p>
                    <h2 class="fw-light text-secondary">Keep learning!</h2>
                    <h5 class="fw-light text-end text-secondary">All the best,</h5>
